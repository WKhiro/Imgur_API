# Imgur API

This simple web application connects to the [Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/?version=latest) and fetches images based on whatever you search for.

## Features

Simply type whatever you want to search for in the search bar, and then press the search button or the ENTER key to fetch images/gifs (Note: This may take a few seconds). Imgur posts that feature videos (MP4 links) are intentionally excluded from query results.

Afterwards, you can hover over any images/gifs you wish to look focus in on, and click on them to view them at their maximum size.

## Potential Improvements

- CSS styling
- Image fetch/render speeds (lazy loading?)
- Pagination or infinite scroll
